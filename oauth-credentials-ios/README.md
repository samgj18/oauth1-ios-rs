# OAuth 1.0

This is a fork from [OAuth 1.0](https://github.com/tesaguri/oauth1-request-rs). All credits go to the original author.

The main difference is that this fork doesn't strictly adhere to the OAuth 1.0 specification, and instead allows for more flexibility in the request signing process,
namely it allows HMAC-SHA256 (and more to come) hashing algorithms.
